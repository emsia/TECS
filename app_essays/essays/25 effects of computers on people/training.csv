the effect computers have on humans is by far a positive one and the outstanding intelligence computers provide must be embraced not feared and avoided whether we like it or not computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future besides for personal usage computers are highly beneficial the main reason people fear computers is because of the dangers is radiates which really isn reasonable when analyzed closely to not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational the computer is the future plain and simple it is inevitable that the computer and technology related to that paint the picture of the future of our world whether people like the concept or not computers will be necessity to solve the problems and calamities that will wreak havoc on the world in time computers can predict natural disasters and with that people in the area of the catastrophes destination can be evacuated lives can be saved computers can calculate pollution margins and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and caps organization nature can be spared so much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use people must adapt to location technology or we will fall behind and watch our caps slip away this proves the effect computers have on people is not only positive but necessary to advance in an evergrowing world stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans computers in most cases do better work and create less error than humans themselves instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water computers can be sent down to visualize the before unattainable areas also faster communication is extremely helpful in certain circumstances such as an occurrence in a workplace causing the area to be offlimits as member of the workplace can simply email his employer informing them of the accuracy and preventing them from putting themselves in danger or simply preventing men the trouble of a commute to work even from location to location with simply the press of caps people across the world can be of the accident foreign communication specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations in the fields of both business and government lastly finding information is so easy with a caps where would be without computers to find information rapidly we would be still going to the library and checking out books reading through page after page to find the information that would have taken less even a minute on a computer even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial as you can see on even a less global level of use the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users the one thing parents especially that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability when these two topics are analyzed it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer installing a program of which there are infinite to choose from that allows good websites to be viewed and bad on potentially dangerous caps to be binded this eliminates all that is heard about online interactions and activity gone bad even without software to block dangerous websites computers are generally safe only nut out of nut websites includes content considered detriments to humans also of those nut nut provide reliable correct information those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder that goes to show that the computers negative aspects can be eliminate leaving only the positives to remain in conclusion computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives computers are the future and have even proven to save lives why wouldn somebody want to save the life of another also the benefits of caps or personal computers are too large and helpful to pass up lastly when viewed carefully computers are very reliable and can be made extremely safe which eliminates the main fear computers we have come so far to create such a safe beneficial and necessary device we must put it to use and by doing so better our own lives and the life of organization,16
computers have been one of technology greatest advances and yet one of society downfall originally thought to spread ideas and faraway places computers have been proven to do quick the contrary computers are dangerous devices and are targeting young wholesome kids it is the main reason why society is today predicting that this future generation is gobbling on an unsteady and weak foundation these devices the source of this mayhem must immediately be removes from society because they take away the true benefits of life have harmful effects on our health and support some of the country deadliest creditors firstly computers are linked with the crime of stealing the pleasures of childhood since date the amount of adolescent users has shot up percent amazing ll enough percent of parents polled admitted that their children spend at least nut hours on the computer everyday this takes away the pleasures or reading exercising spending time outside and hinging with friends and family these negative effects have an unhealthy toll on society especially teenagers the most frequent users as a result diet and exercise are curtailed raising the obesity number by percent and lock of outdoor or family activities have promoted antisocial caps this alarming rate out future generation month indeed be balancing on a cracked foundation in addition to limiting diet and exercise computers are also the source of yet another act as long as the computers are plugged they emit invisible wares of electromagnetic radiation these waves are linked to diseases and cancers use of computers have to cause braintumors and leukemia ass ll as brain disorder and cancers leukemia when caused at a young age is difficult to cusp and stunts the child development children exposed to at least nut hours a day to organization compared to the few who spend their time outdoors are nut times as likely to develop such possibilities the ultimate prevention to such rises is to to the rest of such causes computers and it completely lastly computers are harmful because they also a deadly we open as an adolescent unthinkingly says the web and chtrooms they are at risk of attack by thousands of children creditors prowling the web computers contain extremely valuable and secret information such as names birthdays genders and even social security numbers with one click accepting a stringers invite the online creditors hack into the child computer and oration such valuable information or the creditors month be less positive and attack directlyasking questions to the child themselves in fact a familiar story tells the unfortunate fare of one local caps girl who unknowingly chanted with an online stranger this online creditor smoothly invited her to the mall where they moved a couple devastating weeks later the girls remain in were found burned as the last deadly act the creditor performed on the teen three for computers are simply too dangerous a creditors thumbbook as they search for their next victim by removing the computer you eliminate the threats online creditors pose for your child and you as well it is amazing to learn that technology greats advancement the computer can unleash such harmful effects lack of engaging activities such as exercising and reading are stunted by the ever distracting computer its electromagnetic radiation attacks our health and lastly it supports the acts of the thousands of cruel sneaky online creditors awaiting your child on the web by removing the source of all these troubles those acts can be prevented and society month begin to the pain for reform,16
what computers stop you from doing is your homework in school but when you do something on the computer your not opposes to do you get stuck on a website you can get off your screen so what i trying to say is to don stay on the computer than just nut mink,16
dear editor computers are good for people because it really helps with they work and home work and other stuff,18
dear local newspaper caps my name is person ve just been informed about how people view computers and the effects of them in my opinion i find computers to be a very negative influence on sound kids teens and adults many harmful awareness come along with having one for one thing people being so hypnotized in this electrical device are finding lesser time to exercise and take care of themselves also to the only nature there experiencing is pictures online and not enjoying the full beauty of what we have left of out earth another negative outcome is that they start becoming more and more distant from their loved ones what happened to our society why can we think on our own anymore i truly strongly hope that what i saying will change the minds of some people thank you very much exercise is a very key aspect in anyones life especially growing kids and teens on the computer what exercise benefits are you getting stronger fingers a higher chance of syndrome caps caps percent of kids having caps problems like obesity have access to the internet acceding to person of the caps feel right with caps caps caps in hunington beach location when basically your giving yourself to the computers you month not have any thoughts at all of staying fir instead on some chips while typing caps caps benefits caps that game help with global warming by outside what you saw yesterday month not be there today breathing in some fresh natural air can really calm a stressed child out what ever happened to playing an endless sloth with side walk chalk and fresh or tag or just running around is it not cool anymore ah not cool to take care of yourself inspire yourself by writing poems about how you feel or draw a secretary now a days instead of caps liming a tree were climbing our mouse arrow to the next website there so much that we all take for granted that one day when you look back on t all your going to really miss those date days family time is so critical in anyones life without a family your nothing when did game night or family time disappear just because were in a society that says computers are completely normal everyday thing in a house doesn mean you family and friends arena a main priority to you anymore if you want to hangout a friends house don email about it walk caps there and get the full affect since when does a computer a family never if we got out of a fake reality caps there wouldn be relativity in our life caps you can regain a true life back with them caps you think more clearer just caps what makes a computer any better than life nothing ask yourself that so inconclusive i strongly believe that with this in you lives wee actually get dumber there more negative than positives in having a computer sure you could quickly send them a message or like caps but is it ever bad to do the good old fashion calling or sending letter i say again thank you for taking out your time to read this caps i changed you caps not whatever you do think about the next time your online and see what happens,18
organization caps are you there caps you hear me you never have that issue with computers it has come to my understanding that there is a dispute about the benefits of computers should we have them and advance them or not well i believe that computers are a necessity to an average person computers help everyone and make life easier sure there are telephones and other helpful electronics but caps they always prove trustworthy computers are always reliable whether its for homework or another reason computers provide easy interaction without breakups they make it easier to learn and if you are smart then they are safe without computers who knows where our society would be to begin computers allow people to have conversations with othersthat are halfway across the world there are a variety of applications that you caps choose from and they are all easy to use my personal proffered option is organization email i myself have family in location which is a whole continent away sure i could call them but my phone bill would be through the roof how else am i supposed to keep intact with my loved ones do you know how many others face the same problem through a recent study nut out of nut families in location say they have relatives that are far away that is percent of locations population imagine there was no computer for them to use phone companies would be in money and regular families would be living on the streets or worse they would lose any relationship with their family do you want that computers are easy to access and you caps interact with loved ones friends or new people it doesn get any better than that so which would you choose losing your family relations or keeping in touch via email and computer applications if that isn enough computers make it easy to learn new things and accomplish tasks i know that as a student of person other students and i need to type our homework at least three times a week just yesterday i had to type up a response a free writing choice and an entry for a history project imagine if we had to go back to using typewriters either homework wouldn be done or everyone would have a major lack of sleep both options are unacceptable plus computers are great for research if you have to look up a new country look at far away colleges or find out about the world why not visit your handy computer you could learn which college is right for you without leaving your house you could visit a new country without leaving town sure you could read a newspaper but answer me this where does the paper come from pup trees are killed for them computers are the easy environment friendly alternative for you if those two reasons dint convince you maybe this one will most people think computers are unsafe and that month be partly true but if you are smart or listen in school like me you will know that isn always the case in our school we are taught about the risks of computers and how to prevent any possible caps i sure most schools do in fact nine out of ten students say that when it comes to safety computers are rated an a everyone knows about hackers and so we avoid them my parents even say that for over thirty years they have never had a single issue or risk of safety when using a computer and neither have i caps are only powerful if you let them be and let them take control says caps an expert on the subject so if its safety you are worried about then don the kids of today and tomorrow know what is out there and how to stop the minor caps so why don we reap what we learned today are computers helpful and the best way to go for communication yes they are what is the best way to learn now things easily i believe the correct answer is computers what are safe even if some don agree it want phones no not television oh yes computers i see why you might think no they should be outside well let me tell you telephones and tv will keep them from that anyway at least computers don rot your brain well i have done my part i support computers and their advancement but it isn up to me is it no its not so please do your part by spreading the word its the right thing to do you know that you want to,17
i agree with the newspaper people are spending too much time on the computer and not exercising everyone knows computers addictive but people need to get out more but people making it more addicting by creating things such as never ending games and its distracting people from there life family work and exercise,17
nowadays the technological industries are taking over the modern society and are captivating users making them virtually addicted what good is that these indulged in the online world are less interactive and showed more signs of depression in recent studies also if you are sitting around on the computer all day you arena burning calories so you are gaining unnecessary weight that could easily be prevented going to the library is just as useful if not more useful than going on the internet lastly have you thought of the damaging affects romans cuber bullying violence in other words computers are just a negative waste of good money families are becoming less and less connected with each other who to blame its that big book of technology on your desk rather than socializing and just spending time with family and friends computer addicts choose to sit on their butts talking and gaming away they are teaching our family apart caps one location man on her two teenage children computer obsession i swear there on that thing for hours on end she claims in an arrival i was reading the other day it said that most people who suffer depression admitted to being online for atheist nut hours per day what does all of this go to show computers are abuse take them out of your child life or atheist limit them studies prove that percent of people who spend most of their day surfing the web have either overweight or just on the borderline of being overweight rather than going into the real world and experiencing life for themselves they look it up online and rely on other peoples opinions does this mean anything to you people who are overweight have a higher risk of aging and if not then they have some pretty health problems all because they dint want to breath like when in a library environment people tend to be more and more on task you month ask yourself the answer is simply that the is too expansive and distracting if you are in the library you can get in as much trouble you can play online games or even be looking at things that are inappropriate libraries he more credible sources and reliable information to study from not to mention you can go with a family friend of even be tutored computers don provide that going to the library is such a better solution i must admit i was before a computer addict and believe me the effects it has on people are atrocious now that ve moved on from that period of my life i can honestly say the addictive grasp it has on you is strong i know i also know first hand the rewards of being clean from this harmful drug per say i am more sociable than ever and i dealing with issues much better i am nut pounds and in the best shape of my life and i even made by schools cheer team i often go to the library to study and i must say i very proud of who ve become i was spending around nut hours online and getting on sleep if i can do it you can tool my name is caps and i a computer addiction survivor,17
i think that computers do benefit us they allow us to interact with people talk to family far away help us with school gives us easy access to information and much more people usually have family and friends who live away from each other and the computer allows us to interact with them the computer lets us email and instant message them play games against them be their friend on websites like facebook so you can see recent pictures of them its not easy to interact with family and friends who live so far away and the internet allows us to do that the computer doesn just let you talk to family and friends but it lets you meet new people and interact with new people from all over the world it lets you make new friends and play games with them or chat the computer really helps you to just stay in touch with other people and its a very easy and continent way to do so the next thing the computer helps us with is it entertains us children are very viper and after homework is done we don have anything to do so the computer lets us play games on it chat with friends watch movies and videos up load picture etc it does slot for us kids could hang out after school but if they can go on the computer it allows them want to go home where their parents know that their safe and away from drugs alcohol and other bad things they can get into just because kids like the computer that doesn mean that thats the only thing they do kids are very athletic always playing sports and always viper but the computer helps that go away they go to school for hours then go to basketball or football practice sometimes we just need a break the computer isn always fun but its very useful the computer helps us with school it allows us to type essays and projects it also allows us easy information to help write the essays websites like goodie and bing are easy websites to help us get good and accurate information about whatever the topic is that we are doing the computer is very useful when it comes to school as you can see the computer is very important in our lives and makes life slot easy and its your choice how much you want to spend on it but no matter what the computer defiantly benefits us,14
dear newspaper caps you month know a lot of people now a days are constantly on the computer and many people think its a problem well you should know the computer is helpful in many ways such caps learning entertainment and even weight that is just a few out of the hundreds of different things there is to do the computer can help you get in contact with realities you haven seen in a long time or maybe if you have been having some health problems you can go online to see what is wrong i remember my mom has been getting really dizzy and sick and her doctor told her everything was fine but in parent so my mom checked up what was wrong on the computer and found out she had a disease and when she went back to the doctors they figured out she really did and her on a medicine in my opinion the computer was on of the best inventions made it can be used for so many things you can also purchase items over the computer so now i hope you agree with my opinion and support the use of computers,16
the use of computers has been increasing since personal computers were invented although there are some upsides to computers like doing research and interacting with people there are caps more bad aspects then good ones when it comes to computers computers negatively affect the way people live outside the virtual world caps people end up overweight or oblige from spending too much time in a computer chair and not enough time outside exercising people also tend to interact with people on the computer that they don talk to out in the world or that they don know at all people also give out personal information to people they don know which leads me to my second point thefts happen everyday across the globe whether its robbing a bank a store or even someone identity using a computer can lead to caps thefts there are people that hack into peoples banking account which has all your personal information on it and withdraw any sum of money that they like millions of people have all of their information online for anyone to see and this is very dangerous that is another downside to computers my final point that is to be made is all the costs that come with computers caps people have to spend a lot of money on glasses because they looked at a computer nearly all the time some people even must pay for ream there are people out there who are actually addicted to the internet so they have to pay thousands of dollars to get back to health as you can see there are caps more cons than pros when it comes to computers any of these things could happen to you so i advise you not to use a computer,14
dear newspaper i think computers are a good thing people use computers for business computers allow you to interact with people far away they also allow you to do research that is why i think computers are good computers can be used for many different things they can be used for business some people work at home on computers they can also be used to interact with people far away you can interact with someone who you don see on a daily basis computers can also be used for research you can do research on a school project or on other businesses you interact with computers are good some people use computers for business you can also interact with people far away you can even do research on a computer that is why computers are good,16
i think that computers have a good effect on people when people are on the computer they are not on for very long i also think computers have a good effect on people because of the new technology computers are positive and they can help you when you are stuck or need to look something up to me computers are positive when people go on the computer they are not on for nut hours straight sure they might be on nut hours in a day but they do other stuff in between like school meals and activities some people need computers for their caps news caps companies need computers for editing and printing out the paper they also put the news on there website what would most people do without a computer computers are positive because of the new technology the new technology is helping people interact over the if you have a long distance friend or family member there are how many ways to talk to them you could use caps sky booboo caps or even email when i go on the computer i don just sit and watch caps caps or caps online i interact with my friends percent of us population between the ages nut have a caps percent have sky or booboo and talk to people that are too far away to visit computers are positive because they can help you with school that you don know just go on the internet and look it up if you need to translate caps to caps just go on the computer and translate it percent of people learned a dictionary there own using the internet if there is a word you want to know and isn i the dictionary look it up and it will be online computers have a positive effect on people nobody spends so much time on the computer that they can go outside or hang out with there friends people actually need the computer for their caps the new technology that is coming out is letting people interact with people across the world they are positive to have for school work definitions and even translation computers are not negative and they don take away what you should do in life,17
yes i do think that we should continue using computers because it helps us stay in contact with other countries around the world it forms a balance and it also makes life simpler first of all computers help us stay in contact with the other countries around the world without computers we would not be able to caps or van video message other countries about important events second we have to balance computers and exerting and interacting with just sitting on the computer but computers can help us interact with family and friends by mailing or video cheating can also help you stay in contact last using computers makes life simpler like how its so much easier to write an caps and not a letter and its easier to instant message someone then to call them also for school projects you can make your project look so much better by adding pictures and different fonts just hand writing it that why agents arena a waste at time because they help us stay in contact with the other countries they form a balance and it also makes life simpler,16
my opinion about the effects of computers is that computers do help you but people should not us the computer to lot because people should exercise interacting with family and enjoy nature exercising is more important than a computers because it will make you health you will not be sick so much interacting with family is more important than a computers because the month help you have friend but not a family help you when you help and maybe that friend in the computer is maybe not real that is why it is important to interacting with family and the last thing that is more important than a computers is enjoying nature it is fun because you are not bored you be outside you will not think about the computer because you will be enjoying so much my opinion is that computers should only be us to see your mail or to learn something you want to find out in the computer,16
i completely agree with those people who think computers have a negative effect on us today even though computers are great they do have many negative effects on people who use them since new technology and post pictures on websites where everyone can see also they have games for computers that people get hooked on lastly there are creditor online the new technology is amazing like webcams where you can video chat or telephones where you could take pictures caps they do have negative effects there have been many suicides over cuber bullying this is where people bully kids over the internet also some people send naked pictures online or even while webcamming this is illegal and absurd that young or even older people would be doing these actions also there are websites where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life there are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of websites most people actually get addicted to the game they would play it all day if they could and if they arena playing they are wishing they could this makes them miss out on slot of things they might not get enough expertise or not do any homework which will make you grades drop they could also not be spending time with family it also might change who you are as a person the most important thing about the use of computers is your safety there are creditor all over the internet and can pretend they are someone from school and ask where you live you should never tell anyone where you live or your full name online they can and most likely will come to your house for you it could most likely cost you or even family members your lives computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it remember not to tell anyone where you live or don take pictures and send them that are personal they could be all over the internet the next day lastly worry about your family grades and health than some useless game be smart and safe,17
computers don have any affect on kids we just love going on cause we use it for help and this persuade the readers of the local newspaper cause we need to be able to communicate also do writing essays and doing social studies or science homework my ideas are let us go computers cause were not bothering s can just leave us alone and let us do what you need to do cause what computers are what give us information for we have to do and were to do rat we grotto do and s people can just leave us alone cause arena addicting to me or anyone and if we were it still would it matter cause a computers a computer s don punish it because just punish us from the computer punish us because of it cause its the computer fault it can be addicting cause the computer is device that gives us rat we need and the information we also the computer does majors for us the computer is a amazing thing,16
to the computers people technology is a good thing to have if we do not have technology then we can not call no one we will not have computers to go online we can not talk to my family or friends people us technology for they jobs like people that work for cars they need computers to see if the cars if old that is why will need technology people need technology for a lot of thin have technology to us computers is the big thing because we need to look up a lot of things online we need computers to test on we call people with technology you us computers to go online on googlecom that is why we need technology so we can call people,17
i don think that computers is the most positive effect because most computers are not like that the computers are not the smartest but it does help you when you need to do something like a project when you have to look for pictures and when you need help with math you can use the calculator on the computer but the computer does not help you on all your subjects the computer only helps you on a couple of your subjects that is the main reason i use the computer sometimes when i doing homework i let the computer do it for me so it is raiser for me to do and i look for websites on it they give you really good websites that is why mostly everyone uses the computer they mostly use the computer to look for jobs cars or a house that is what they mainly use the computer for most people do not like using the internet because they think its cheating to use the computer,14
you must be insane computers are very important to society my first reason is computers can be used for research secondly can be made lastly you can talk and video chat these are my three reasons why computers are important to society if you want to know more send on firstly computers can be used for research for example what if your boss vats to find the of products all you have to do is go to wwwgooglecom and look it up is is that easy also what if you need to do research on organization for school instead of reading books about him you can type in his name and there your information in caps nut out of nut kidsadults use the computer for research this is my first reason secondly purchases can be made what if you would like to buy a plane ticket to location to help you can go on the computer and buy a ticket at your convenience you can order order all types of that needed to location or that a relativefriend can have a how way simpler than going out and doing it yourself this is my second reason lastly you can talk and video chat you own a other people and you all in different country need a a video meeting what if you have relatives that live far away that you miss slot you can have a video family this is my last reason i hope you consider my reasons why computers are very important to society,17
i think the use of computers is very good things in the present day location i think this because people use it to research stay in touch with friends and family and music these are all things adults and kids need a like to do read on and i will explain why this is so important my first reason why i think computers are good thing is because the are a good source to do research on a specific topic kids all over the location use the internet to do class projects adults can use the computer to look up a certain food recipe if you need help with something the computer is allays there some people even use the computer for a job computers can help with a lot of things another reason why computers are a big help because you can stay in touch with friends and family a great thing to use on a computer is a web can with this you can see and talk to people on a billet cray even if they are far away you can also go on misplace of face book there two websites that are used to post pictures and to talk to chosen friend it is a good way for people to get to know you a similar thing to this is instant messaging you can use this to talk to friends and many on line don stop reading there is more thing my last reason why computer are such a great thing to have is because you can do do much with music on the computer you can use the computer to listen to music and put music on to and pod or nut player some people use the computer to make music you can get a program that you can make heats and put it together to make some kind of a song music is a great thing that all age groups love that is why i think havering a computer is a very positive thing you can do researching say in touch with friends and family and do a lot with music there is so much more then these nut thing that a computer is good for i don think the world would be the same without computers,14
dear local newspaper caps are bringing questioned if the are good for our society or not i would have to say that they are good and bad you really can pick a side these good because children and teens can get the information they need to teach in school it allows people to chat with others in different places and it helps hander coronation those were the good here are some bad things about computers people spend to much time on the computer instead of exercising they don get to enjoy nature and people stop interacting with friends and family anyone can pick a side i just can because i can relate to both sides for example one of the good reasons about computers was that you can chats with other people around the world i can relate to that because when i live here in caps caps my mom and stepped live in location location so i don see them much but thanks to computer i can chat with them when ever i want to honestly i wouldn know how my life would be like if i dint have a computer and i want able i caps now although can also to one or the bad things about computers which is that people spent to much time on the them i can relate to that and so could of the other well because when i around nut because go to a after school go straight on my captor and around nut when my grandma nut pc she always comes in and your on that thing to much you your hands in her so in my opinion i believe that commuters can be good for our society and bad for me there is no side to take others might feel the same way and others month not its up to them to make a choice so ask your self caps you believe that computers are good or bad for our society,16
what i am going to tell you could change the way you think about computer in general people might say that computers are great to be on its fast and you get what you need but i think computers are not good they become addicting and make your bills every high computers can lead to your child sending less time with you and your family also computers can be very dangerous for teens and children of all ages i say that computers are addicting this is a fact percent of students spend most of there time on the computer why are computers so addicting well they have instant message you can talk to people around the world now i know it might not sound bad but this can be bad for your pocket person who works with electron bills says that because children spend more time on the computer the bills in house have grown up almost percent and the harder it is for people to pay there bills computers are what they say now a days are one of the main reason children spend less time with there family this is true in most family like mine because pot computers me and my sisters spend more time on then computer than with each other this can cause arguing and fighting between family statics show that nut people would rather spend more time on the computer talking to people or listening to music than spend time with there own children or parents is this what you want for your you and your children to be separated by secondly computers arena always safe for teens and children of all ages there are many reasons why computers can sometimes not be safe for your children or teens i say this because sometimes we are worried about are kids salty and when your child is on the computer you have no idea who they are talking to or what they are talking about teens are mostlikely going to met other people online and there are talkers posers and other people out there that are pretending to be someone they are not and your child can be one of those peoples who fall for it and it can lead to meeting someone they might not know and they can be kiddnapped ripped anting can happen children can be always get hurt by verbal abuse they can be threatened by others and hurt and that can cause emotional damage so be careful and monitor your child these are just very few things that can happen these are my reason computers arena the really benefiting are society,18
lets go back around nut years ago those were days when it could take weeks to communicate with out of state family days when knowledge was only found in books and oven found slowly those were days where everything was done with a lack of speed and precision computers change all that with nothing but the tap of a finger we can communicate with people worldwide or sea the web for some knew information percent of peoples relatives live out of their state i can relate with nut cousins in location and nut in location without these instant messages and email we would more than likely talk to them once maybe twice a year some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends for me personally and i know many others interaction would be impossible without these modern manuals with all the location technology out there nothing has me as amazed as the webcam you with this tool can talk face to face with someone on the other side of the world the world is a better place when we can have a true connection to other cultures and what better way than to talk to them what people nut years ago would never think possible we can use at a moments notice and yet still many people don appreciate it my caps and my caps have both used internet to reunite with old college buddies or see how far away friends are these are grown ups using the tools available to improve their lives internet goes beyond teenagers on caps and caps what you can find online still amazes me the information you could get out of nut conjunction books you could find in turn minutes on the internet any question including personal anything can be answered years ago people would have killed for this power for the common man to be able to access all he ever needed to i see the point people make about needing excessive and there right but in five minutes on the web you could have an exercise routine planned out with modern techniques and styles the computer has anything for anyone looking for some place to enjoy nature organization it in seconds there will be thousands thousands of results missing a dictionary there are literary hundreds of sites to find a definition online people take these machines for granted and assume we could live without them but i doubt they ever realize how much we really need them the technology is there why not use it i could never turn down an opportunity to talk to a distant cousin or another kid from a different country i couldn pass up a chance to check up on some old buddies that moved away thanks to computers i have that opportunity i have that chance ve been shown an open door to find out everything i could want man can know everything but these days he can find out anything i not sure if the computer has changed the direction of advancing technology but i can tell you it has definitely offered the course,17
computers are very helpful in many of ways i believe that computers can a very great needed affect on you caps can cause you to caps caps and cheap caps the computer can caps you in many interesting ways the fast rat caps can caps is caps helping other plan caps vacations by money to them also caps can caps by know how to do different things like caps if you get lost or show you how to get there the second way is helps is to give caps the computer can give you plenty of caps i use the computer caps caps caps of caps also gives me caps about a caps college that i would caps and like to attend to the last way the computer helps out the its with box from there if you caps online you can in the computer i caps this machine because you don have to buy something that just come out caps the real expensive caps you can just caps online and caps caps caps a cheaper caps also caps mom wanter to caps new caps on the dealer but caps was expensive so went online and bought caps cheaper than the would sell caps to us this is how the computer can come in handy when you need caps this is why i believe that computer you,15
dear local caps i think computers benefit society treaty most of what we do today could not happen without computers the biggest use of computers is communication if your in location on a business trip but need to send a letter to your company you can send an email which is much less expensive than paying for as piece of caps the experts concerns that people arena spending enough time with family and friends is a point many people cominucate with family and friends through computers i would hardly yet to talk to my cousin if i couldn go on facebook i would have had to wait another month to find out my other cousin was engaged if i dint follow her on caps if the concern is face to face contact the computer has a cure for that too a video messaging site called booboo another way computers allow communication is through the sharing of information many facts needed for school are spread out in hundreds of books over the caps ve done research for a project and have been able to get facts from the organization and organization about crime state many times researching an animal will take you online because more modern books note good website to travel to for more information without the caps a simple research project could take for months some scientists think people are spending too much time on the computer this both right and wrong sitting at a computer watching youtube for hours is not nessasarily the best thing however the caps is also for computer the caps has designed a game so that you can have fun while getting excessive computers are like chocolate they can be good but too much is a bad thing,17
computers are mind browning on what they can do they can make or break someone financhely they also can verdure amazing graphs that artist can verdure computes are also for great for ricer anal activity and they also take your life away i not talking about a real life caps talking about the activity you do away from home now lets see the benefits and problems we come so far on how we handle money we use to put it in chats and hide them now all we do is click and type in a security number people can also invest in items but investing is tricky you don always win you can win small or lose big they say caps computers today are d the screens are made of a liquid crystal formula that hardens the lights in the back pixels do most of the word to bring stunning graphs to life on computers today people make money by selling graphs they made on computers so this would be another plus on what a computer dose to a human i went to a school to fern how to verdure great graphs all teens kids and adults have used a computer for recerantol activity on todays computers you can play games watch videos and listen on computers people do this to envoy then shelfs some people ran get in trouble for fooling around on the web but there is nothing stressed out and just playing some games for a while person i like to go on youtube and find funny videos after school i use to own a youtube account and get many views the worst thing about coumpurts is it can ruin plan goto or someone local life some people get addicted and can stop being on the computer until it is taken away for example some people play world of war craft get addicted and can stop i had a problem when i had to chef you tube a lot well i hoped you readers no matter what happens i think computers benefit more than the problems,14
more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society well to me it does benefit society in many ways like learning online you can learn many things online you can practice math reading and even writing you can also have fun online if your bored at home and have nothing to do also you can interact with friends and family members by email etc when your online you can learn slot of things if your at home and you need to study for a test you can go online and study you can also learn more because you can learn how to do a math problem if you don know it or just catch up on reading people sometimes need a computer because they might be bored so they can go online and play games and have fun people especially kids get bored at times so they can just go on the computer and play games and trivia so they can still learn computers can let you interact with your family and s rinds you can email or webcam if you haven talk to someone a long period of time you can just go to the computer and talk to them if you want to find a caps school classmate that you haven talked to in years you can now computers do benefit the society in my own opinion we do need computers if parents do not want their child on websites they don approve of the parents can always block those websites computer are really nessacary they can help in a huge way,16
i think we can all agree that computer usage is a very controversial issue in my opinion i believe that computers have a negative effect on people for instance its not safe and children can get into all sorts of things on the internet also people spend too much time in front the computer now a days caps its a major distraction and also a negative effect on kids school work its now or never do we divide that computers have a negative effect you decide isn every parents biggest concern the safety of their children when on the internet kids are capable of accessing anything and everything sometimes kids don even look for bad things they just pop up would you want your child veining things that you have no control over also websites like capscom one one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety although you are supposed to be at least nut to have a caps most kids lie about their age did you know that nut out of nut caps users lie about their age and its not always a nut year old saying they are nut it could be a nut year old saying there nut not only do people lie about their age they lie about who they are is this the kind of internet exposer you want for your children put a stop to this right now more than percent of caps are overweight and unhealthy this is another negative effect computers have on people its a gorgeous date day bright blue skies cotton candy clouds the sun is shining and there a nice warm breeze perfect day to go out and get active right wrong none people would caps be inside on the computer instead of going for a walk people would caps spend hours on facebook this is a serious concern to our health people don exercise enough as it is and then when you add computers people will never get active instead of playing video games online people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun beighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial this is just one step caps need to take to get a healthier lifestyle wouldn you agree did you know that kids that spend more time on computer are more likely to do poorly in school surely if nothing else will convince you of the negative effects of a computer this will caps than coming home and doing homework more time is spent in front of the computer as a student i will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies you can expect a child to make the right decision and tell their they have to go because they need to study so you do take action now or your child will definitely suffer the time has come to decide do you believe computers have a negative effect on people its clear that the computer is not safe not to mention too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active most importantly computers will negatively affect children grades don wait another minute lets agree and do something about this,14
to whom caps month concern caps the joy of just clicking a mouse and all of the sudden you are talking with a friend you haven seen in years computers make this a reality for us but that isn the only benefit they offer computers help society by providing us with search engines and educational resources allowing us to connect easily with friends and family helping us communicate importance and plan things and a lot more first computers have become a vital part of education and research a like students at schools elementary through college are able to connect with much more information than without computers you can even earn a college degree on the computer thats right online universities are beginning to form this is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children also computer technology has been applied to research in science and hospitals new discoveries have advanced with the help of computers that will actually help peoples lives computers are used to search for a cure to cancer disasters such as earthquakes and even help see a disease someone has before its symptoms even begin to occur computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago secondly computers allow people to connect and reconnect with other people around the caps i recently got a facebook account and within a few days i had found and to three friends of mine that had moved away a distant cousin who had moved to location that i haven seen since we was little and even my great grandmother the possibilities are endless email has also been very beneficial to society as well as caps helps people communicate and plan events which brings me to my next topic lastly computers help the caps communicate with one another the internet is filled with websites made to benefit our caps one being organization caps caps caps if not for computers this program wouldn have been as successful and beneficial as caps has become also is an amazing website that combines education with the aspect of caps caps quizzes you on different levels of general knowledge and for each correct answer organization donates nut grains of organization when i am bored i sometimes go on and so for i have filled over thirty bowls of organization while learning at the same time to conclude computers have proven to benefit the caps and all in caps not only people but the environment too computers help advance research help people reconnect with one another and help the caps communicate who knows that computers will help us accomplish next,14
dear caps caps do people benefit from the use of computers some say that using computers rather than exercising and being outside is a bad thing i personally believe that the use of computer technology is a good thing computers teach hander ordination help people learn and allow people to communicate with others the use of computers teach hander ordination and reaction time some say that being outside and exercising is better than using a computer but many computer games help hander ordination alter playing computer games more and more the time it takes for you to react to the game you are playing and hit the mouse button is very important these skills could help you in the activities you take part in and every day life personally i play a lot of caps nut a computer gaming system caps has helped no hander ordination greatly and it has shown in the four sports that i play clearly computers can be very helpful and can help your hand eye ordination computers can also help people learn in many ways there is a lot of content on the internet that simply can be in school the ability to learn about foreign countries is a big part in learning as a student i use the internet wearily every night to type my papers and find the information that i need it has helped one as a student also typing papers on computers is becoming the new caps of hand writhing teachers are beginning to require that school work is typed on a computer and printed documents can be saved do that they cannot be lost unlike a hard copy written by hand although many believe that using a computer is a waste of time it can also help you stay organized many people have calendars in their computers that send you reminders on your schedule your computer is also where your data like music and pictures can be saved computers are also very useful for learning and organizational purposes we can communicate with others using computers people use computer technology to communicate everyday through caps caps and chat if i need to know what our homework is or when practice is i use my computer to ask someone for the answer before i began communicating with my computer talking to others was much harder to do although many disagree with using computer technology computers are often the way we communicate with foreign countries when something happens overseas the first way we found out about it is a computer it is essential for us to use computers to communicate with other nations clearly computers are important for communication purposes we must continue to use computers for multiple reasons although many disagree with the use of computers there hand eye communications and learning purposes are very important without computer technology we would function much differently it is up to you to continue using computers,14
dear local newspaper i feel that negative effects of computers on people is much greater than the positive effects computers have caused a massive amount of obesity in the location and that number is growing everyday computers can also be timeconsuming and people could spend hours and even days on a computer without doing anything else lastly computers can be dangerous to many kids and could even end up in death i feel that computers are too harmful for society and should be stopped obesity is caps of the biggest problems in the location and is growing bigger everyday over percent of location population is obeyed and computers have been a major contributer put yourself in the mind of a computer addict it is dinner time and you are hungry but you don want to lose too much time off of your computer you hurry down to the nearest fastfood store and by yourself a cheeseburger fries and a soda you then go back to your house and eat the food while on your computer not only is the fastfood bad for you but you don even give your body a chance to burn caps those calories and carbohydrates that you just ate by exercising computer addicts do this almost everyday and before they know it they are nut pounds in addition people who their hander coordination can do it in every other ways than just going on a computers contribute to a large portion of the obeyed population but they also can be extremely timeconsuming people on computers waste a huge amount of their timer these people stay on their computers for hours am sometimes they don even realize it they say caps let my check my email caps look i relieved a caps caps let me just change my caps account caps thing thing another and caps of a madden nut or nut hours have already passed by people who stay on computers caps day waste precious time could be spent with family exercising or finding a true love time is sam precious in our lives and we must not waste it staying o a computer caps day not only can they be time consuming computers can also be dangerous kids around the country are being killed raped and bulled caps to computers they show their pictures on chat sites give away too much information and enough they have a critical knocking on their front door also those been who suicide because they were bulled on the caps cyberbullying can be just as harmful if not more harmful than regular bullying these kids fare such strong mental and emotional harm that they make bad decisions including suicide and nut in school in addition there can be explicit content on the caps including pictures and video that can harm a child young mind the danger of computer is so great than they should be caps in caps computers are too risk for which is why they shouldn be a time consuming lastly they can be extremely dangerous to children because of these should be banned from caps society for the well using of the location,17
some experts are warned that people should spend too much time on their computers yet look at all of the advantages to an computer you can develop better hander coordination skills internet with friends and family who could live hundreds of miles away and you can learn about cultures all around the world along with the people who live in those countries without ever leaving home in my opinion computers overall benefit society helping us learn more more every day first off there are many skills you can develop on the computer for example when playing interactive highpaced games kids get a sense of awareness timing and hander coordination not to mention with new advances in technology people can now go to college without ever leaving home and at a much lower price while still getting a great education many people even work from home thanks to their computers these are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers secondly why buy a ticket to a far away country thats fairly expensive trade in all your money for the money they have there go through the hassles of baggage sect when you could simply go online and look it up on the computer you can go online look up some of that countries recipes language pictures people without the hassle of going there not to mention for kids who arena old enough to or have to do a report on it instead of making through countless textbooks newspapers libraries in general they go online their country and they have must if not all the into they need right there so not only is getting the information then you wouldn learned in the first place thereby extending your knowledge finally the internet helps people connect leading experts from the government or family security agency says that since people have started using programs like email and facebook many more families who live in different countries have been able to reconnect and get to know oneanother for example if you have an uncle who lives in texas you could both buy cameras for your computer install them and within minutes be seeing each othertalking face to face i think this is better then simply writing letters to them as its quicker and you get to connect more same goes if a friend or you move away but want to stay in touch a quick facebook account or sky and you still be good friends so all in all yes computers do benefit society as they help teach people skills learn about distant culturesfar away countries and connect people who might live in different countries i don see anything wrong with these beneficial factors to society so yes computers have a positive effect on people,14
dear organization caps has been brought to my attention that some people feel that computers are bad for us some people say that they are a distraction to our physicaland mental health although i can see how some people would think this i believe that computers are a good benefit to all society i believe this because computers can help people learn stay intact with friends or family that live faraway and stay orginized sometimes people are on the computer learning and they don even know caps simply by visiting the organization homemade you automatic see the news feeds of things happening around the world other times people go online deliberately to learn if someone is thinking about going to location then they would probably go on the internet to learn about caps simply by searching equator many choices will pop up you climate seasonal weather hotel options and other arts but thats not the only way people are learning on the internet now many college students have the option of taking their lessons online this is because some students like calm quietness or own house the distractions of sitting in class friends could be a big distraction in class but how can you stay touch with your friends if they moved away i remember in second grade my befriend location move away i was so sad i baden ever talked to her but then one day our parents set us up on a video chat i felt like i was right their with her this was great and i though about how many people could use this to talk to relatives or friends another great way to stay touch into friends and family is through email by writing a message and sending caps can make staying in touch so ease and your personal wants can chat and email are a ease thing to send world wide so many people love to type on a keyboard as well but so many different papers that you type could be lost i for me hate clutter and i have so many school binders for papers to be lost in this is why i take great advantage of typing my paper every chance i get my computer keeps me orginiced because i could never loose my work file save is an idiot proof way to keep all your files in a safe place then all you have to do is press print to get a hard copy i am sure that many people love using their computer for the same reason also i myself am a much faster typer than i am writer so my work is a lot needy on the computer as you can see their are plenty of reasons why using a computer is hoof for our society you can learn stay touch with friends and family and stay orginiced many people could agree with me don you,17
"the computers are cool do you now i werpsite is numcom we node to time the let lomenteno it i love the computers we node nut make a computers are gene computers",57
"computers are good because people can find what they need and their fun ask things find places get things for a good price",88
"i personally think certain materials such as books music movies magazines etc should not have to be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive first of all how do we define offensive is it something that discriminates a certain group of people is it something that creates negative attention is it something we don like anybody can walk in a library and find something they did not like but that does not automatically mean it is offensive the national geographic magazine often has pictures of naked people and so does the caps magazine so which one would we have to put censorship on the answer is we don put one because this would start a big argument of which is offensive and which is motif would cause a conflict of two different sides it is only offensive when we make it offensive we do not have to look at something we don likest all have a choice and we can choose not to pick up something we might think is offensive the organization month not get along with the caps but if both were in a library together with both of their holy books on the shelves they cannot say ones book is offensive to another because it does not agree with theirs we sometimes forget we have the amendment that allows us to the freedom of speech and press we month not like what one person publishes but it doesn make their work offensive because it might be for a certain of group that likes it which is not offensive to themeverything in the library has a purpose and if it does not fit our purpose then there is no way it word be offensive to us the library is a place for books music movies magazines ewe come to the library to check out books for a research in order to learn we also go to the library to read the newest book of a series putting a censorship on these things would not enable us to do these we can finish our research project because someone thought one book was offensive or we can listen to new album capture released because some people think the lyrics are too offensive putting a censorship would upset the general public more than not having a censorship because if everyone can check out what they want from the library then everyone is content",73
"many people say that computer is help them in their every day life a few examples are you could learn about places you dint know about by searching on goodie you get facts reviews about the place you are exercising your fingers it helps with communicating with other people it can help you find long lost family it reunite lots of family friends you might have been looking for also with hand eye coordination and that means you can writetype without having to look at other features that camel through with a computer is going online you can look browse at things available in a store without driving all the way to the store wasting gas polluting the air imp a way of finding what happening world wide breaking news you can still interact with family friends can meet new people there email instant messaging much more so you can always interact with if they don have a account signing up is if you just go into nature you don know what there you could look it up and find out what the park has to offer and that concludes my opinion on how computers are helpful lots of diverse ways",78
"do you spend all or most of your freetime sitting at your computer people are spending too much time on computers obesity is a growing problem in todays society people need to interact with eachother and we need to get some fresh air computer are ruining these things for people unplugs yourself from your computer more and more people are becoming obeyed this is do to spending too much time sitting down in front of computers there is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer people need to get outside and go dogging play games or ride their bikes cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face to our whole life we will have to interact and socialist with others if you don develop these skills you wont be happy where you end up talking to people over the computer is nowhere near close to talking to someone face to face get out and get some fresh air go experience nature bring out on the beach hiking in the woods or even just sitting on the swing in your backyard can be the most fresh air clear your mind time says that kids who spend time outside receive better grades than they would if they were inside on the computer people need to release stress so go outside click turn off your computers and get out of your chair go get some exercise go interact with friendsand family or even just go outside and get some fresh air while relaxing people are wasting too much time on their computers and its flushing our society down the toilet so just turn off your computer",87
