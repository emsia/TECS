"i personally think certain materials such as books music movies magazines etc should not have to be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive first of all how do we define offensive is it something that discriminates a certain group of people is it something that creates negative attention is it something we don like anybody can walk in a library and find something they did not like but that does not automatically mean it is offensive the national geographic magazine often has pictures of naked people and so does the caps magazine so which one would we have to put censorship on the answer is we don put one because this would start a big argument of which is offensive and which is motif would cause a conflict of two different sides it is only offensive when we make it offensive we do not have to look at something we don likest all have a choice and we can choose not to pick up something we might think is offensive the organization month not get along with the caps but if both were in a library together with both of their holy books on the shelves they cannot say ones book is offensive to another because it does not agree with theirs we sometimes forget we have the amendment that allows us to the freedom of speech and press we month not like what one person publishes but it doesn make their work offensive because it might be for a certain of group that likes it which is not offensive to themeverything in the library has a purpose and if it does not fit our purpose then there is no way it word be offensive to us the library is a place for books music movies magazines ewe come to the library to check out books for a research in order to learn we also go to the library to read the newest book of a series putting a censorship on these things would not enable us to do these we can finish our research project because someone thought one book was offensive or we can listen to new album capture released because some people think the lyrics are too offensive putting a censorship would upset the general public more than not having a censorship because if everyone can check out what they want from the library then everyone is content",17,73
