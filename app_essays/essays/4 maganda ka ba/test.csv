dear local newspaper i just read about your article regarding the computer usage in my opinion i think that computers are a good thing yet i believe that it could have a negative influence as well i believe that computers are one of mankind s best technologies you can type learn about historical happenings different places and different cultures as well you can talk to people from far away by using chat or the webcam that s what i use to speak to my caps s who live in location computers are one of the best things that has happened to me and my life however although computer can be such a good thing it can be bad as well a lot of people over used it too i infant know a person and she s a very nice person she s sweet caring loves kids and has a kind heart the only thing is is that she s a caps addict she loves caps sometime when she comes over i ll be using my captor and she ll ask to check her caps status my point is is that she allows caps to take over her not cool i read an article the other day about computer usage in location d person covered this article on the topic of computer usage she said the average american spends four hours or more on the computer although there are other people who spend their time outside when it s nice i congratulate them on that see now you heard it from the expert as well in conclusion i would like to state that computers can have either a positive influence or a negative one as well so it all depends on how you use it and how much time you spend on it so my point that i would to come across location is that use you computer wisely don t spend all of your time on it life s too short for that so spend time with family and friends and go outside too,,16
