i think we need our computers if we don have computers we wont be able to connect to our family that could live in another state or country i no how there is testing now but some people don even have phone or nothing how can you connect to them you can call it might not be free with the phone plan you have if a family member come and visits you they would probably email you about it but if there is no computers they can tell when there coming are they gong do show unispectly they might not even be home and if they show up without them knowing there out of luck and we exercise on our overcome we pick what time and we do it and if we play a sport were enjoying nature some people might have jobs that take place outside of if there are needs that are on computers all day long but in sure they enjoy nature i don know about exercising but they have a car and every thing they drive and things also about the exercising every on has to exercise to stay in shape in pretty sure people don want to be fat there whole life they want to look good and feel good about there self if it is a holiday or something and people want to send them something to wish then of whatever holiday it is there not don be able to see them in person if they live so far away unless they plan to meet each other but even if they do that there don want to email then not call were it costs money and testing only comes with certain plans of phone so all there is left is smiling sometimes people will more from of you that your always on the computer if your not don worry at least you get to email your family that you don ever seen these reasons are my opinion that don get rid of computers and other things,,17
although some people believe that computers turn us children into hobbies i believe that they effect us in a positive way computers can help us explore far away places that we month never go to maybe help us connect with an old friend or just a little help on homework one reason why i think computers are only helping us is they help us explore the places i know for a fact that every kid dreams of a place that they would love to visit but not at all of us can afford to travel far away most families however do have computers with these computers kiss with a parents permission can use the internet to learn tons of cool facts about their place i have always wanted to go to location but my parents just don have the proper income said person of caps caps caps school caps i used my caps and the internet to discover hundreds of amazing facts on it caps as you can see computers can help people realize their dreams another reason why i think computers are good is they help you connect with friends if you are like me you like to talk to your friends a caps but sometimes they are too far away to call if you don want to pay for it a solution a new wonderful machine called the caps you can chat long distances without being for it this is especially good for me because not too long ago one of my best friends moved away to location i thought i would never talk to him again then i learned about caps caps it allows you to talk whenever you want whenever you want now me and my friend can stay in touch and caps can you my final reason as to why i think computers are good is they can help you on homework too even have a tricky path problem you couldn figure out how about the capital of a state that visit slipped your mined well the caps can solve both of those problems and more percent of computers these days come with soft wear in them that comes with a calculated for the other percent you can download and install softer onto your caps for a low price and every caps made in this world has internet capabilities all you need to do is it on and get ready for a ride caps don worry about too much caps use because computers can only help us not hurt us caps remember computers help us live our dreams to the full extent they also help us connect with no another and help us expel in school caps get on and get going have you used your caps today,,7
i completely agree with those people who think computers have a negative effect on us today even though computers are great they do have many negative effects on people who use them since new technology and post pictures on wester where everyone can see also they have games for computers that people get hooked on lastly there are creditor online the new technology is amazing like webcams where you can video chat or telephones where you could take pictures caps they do have negative effects there have been many suicide over saver building this is where people bully kiss over the internet also some people send naked pictures online or even while webcamming this is illegal and absurd that young or even older people would be doing these actions also there are wester where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life there are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of wester most people actually get addicted to the game they would play it all day if they could and if they agent playing they are wishing they could this makes them miss out on clod of things they might not get enough exercise or not do any homework which will make you grades drop they could also not be spending time with family it also might change who you are as a person the most important thing about the use of computers is your safety there are creditor all over the internet and can pretend they are someone from school and ask where you live you should never tell anyone where you live or your full name online they can and most likely will come to your house for you it could most likely cost you or even family members your lives computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it remember not to tell anyone where you live or don take pictures and send them that are personal they could be all over the internet the next day lastly worry about your family grades and health than some useless game be smart and safe,,14
