have you ever thought about all the amazing things that computers have done for us now we can learn about anything we want talk with people on the other side of the world and even advance in other areas of technology computers have without a doubt had a positive effect on people just imagine this one second you can be in the blazing deserts of location the next in a loss steady jungle thriving with animals all without leaving your room using computers people can learn about new places and things whenever they want the millions of resources on the internet make it possible to learn about t other places and times although this information month be in a local library going on the computer is much easier who want to go through the trouble of loaning books from the library when the internet is there for your use any time no registration to get a library card no late fees and no waiting lists it is quite clear that using your computer to do research is a very valuable thing nut out of ten people said that they would rather email a person than talk on the phone with them now with computers people can instant message or email anyone anywhere in the world making a call from location to location can be very expensive but with email i can talk to my caps friend person free of charge i remember when she moved to location it was sad but we promised to stay in touch with s mail and instant messaging it was easy to talk and exchange the latest news having the ability to communicate with someone easily is an unbelievable privilege that would be none existent without computers to help us lastly computers have helped people make advances in other areas of technology where would we be in science and medicine without computers these machines have helped scientists to do experiments with a simulated experiment they can be positive that no other variables will affect your results now experiments can be extremely accurate computers have helped advance medicine as well they have been the key to unlocking all sorts of cures for dangerous diseases who knows maybe in nut years there ill be a cure for cancer all of these amazing accomplishments have been positively effected by computers although some people month think that computers have a negative impact on our day to day life i percent disagree people have learning talking and advances in technology with one click of a mouse computers have effected people positively in many ways so click away computers have none of that,1
more and more people are using computers on a daily basis but i do not agree that this benefits our society people are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends as people use computers more they are spending less time exercising and staying healthy professor person has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than nut hrs a day are overweight and do not expertise regularly he goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become beast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age nut i have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well last year i had a friend who weighed nut labs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that following year he stopped exercising and gamed over nut labs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups i do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy not only do computers less on unhealthy life style it also causes spend less time with family and friends studies show that percent of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer this month not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that percent children who spend less time with their families grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depression i remember when a new came to our school from he wasn t that kid and didn t many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and i found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents so far that week of from the rest of the students and don t much then the we got back the date he wasn t at school and for the rest of the week he didn t show up either and finally on date and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found so people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely more and more people are using computers daily basis but i do not agree that this is benefiting our society people are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time exercising and staying healthy also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends i know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse,1
i do you think that if you use the computers too much then you will not exercise and you will not enjoy the outside nature with talking and playing with your friends and family will do not because computers are need for over needs and one click can help lot of people and can save live and the more advances over technology become we will all so advances like or help a person look for a need sod and you can still talk or chat with best friends or just your grand mom the computer can help with your home work or someone to fern to talk in english and to jump start than new sod or store and so they can but that they her will like and buy so if they like it they will come back for more to higher more people and to make it into lot of store and all so and good resin the computer is good to cook food and to make new resizes all in one clip of the hose,5
the innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery unfortunately the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty with the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterested in perhaps even an inability to enjoy nature on top of this destruction of the mind this monster is the cruel cause of many declining relationships for who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an internet game as unique and intriguing as the computer might be it is slowly destroying the mind increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day while playing on the computer the mind month be racing but the body sits removing caps activity is being done indeed for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food use a restroom go to bed or when a parent demands it all of the day s food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off meanwhile in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtime are pushed later sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires even nature suffered from the advent of computers fewer people went out to admire its beauty nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed attached as people are to computers they cannot experience the world to the fullest some argue that flora and fang can be found online but seeing a picture is different almost cheating compared to being beside the plant able to study it from all angles rather than in an removing form the experience is not the same also computers are indoors so the true world is shielded from view even nowadays with captors if one was to be brought outside the user would be focusing on the screen not what is around them computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature even family and friends suffer when computers are around many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen they tend to onlypretend to listen half the time even when charting with friends online the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet frequently during conversations without a computer nearby the mind is focused on something from earlier that day relationships are suffering and computers are at fault computers are sucking in society more of it each day much of what is done on computers like the study of faraway places can easily be found in books computers have resulted in a lack of exercise less time with nature strained relationships and a generally unhealthy lifestyle through all of this they have returned little to society why does the world continue to put up with computers and their negative effect on humanity,1
