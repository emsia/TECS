being active has no limit but technology does,12
i think computers are good because some people don have phone so caps a good way to connect with people you know also meet new people second some people are going to college when there done with high school so you could just look on the computers and find one you like and princess also find ways there third reason is shopping if a holiday is coming up you could check online and find stuff for cheap and nice to you you could also order it to your house online if you don got clod of time to go shopping caps some reasons why i think online is good you could chat find places and princess colleges and also shop online caps why online is good,7
yes i do think that we should continue using computers because it helps us stay in contact with other countries around the world it forms a balance and it also makes life simpler first of all computers help us stay in contact with the other countries around the world without computers we would not be able to caps or even video message other countries about important events second we have to balance computers and excising and interesting with just sitting on the computer but computers can help us interact with family and friends by smiling or video cheating can also help you stay in contact last using computers makes life simpler like how its so much easier to write an caps and not a letter and its easier to instant message someone then to call them also for school projects you can make your project look so much better by adding pictures and different forts just hand writing it that why agents agent a waste at time because they help us stay in contact with the other countries they form a balance and it also makes life simpler,7
i believe computers are a benefit to society computers help hand eye combination they make it easy to learn about different places and allow people to talk and video chat computers teach hand eye combination when tying and eventually you get so good you don ever have to look down at the keyboard you can search for anything on the internet and if you want to learn about a country you can search it and find out all new things you never knew before maybe you want to go on action to another country and can decide which country to go to you can go on the computer and look up tourist attractions in those country to decide which are you want to go to if you are on action or live in a different place from you and want to see them you can video chat with them over the computer those are the reasons why i think that computers are a benefit to our society,9
how do you think the world would be without computers i think it would bring us back a couple of ages we need computers for communication and to learn things that need to learn without computers our country would be nothing people say you don get enough exercise and don enjoy nature enough well there are ways to do that too communication is one of the greatest things about computers teenager love to caps caps eachother when there at home because its so fast its like really talking to them caps caps is another thing people love to use bosses of companies use caps caps to send caps to everyone so there all on the same page there is also a new video chat were you can talk face to face with someone and see them from the other side of the world if you wanted to you can also learn all you need to know on computers they have dictionary sites history sites encyclopedia sites etc you can find any certain time in history and have a whole site on it or a site called wikipedia you can look up a certain thing and get a whole web page dedicated to the into of that object or person schools also use sites to help students have their knowledge they have path sites english sites caps studies sites and a science teacher favorite caps caps for everything you need to know about science they also have lots of wester for help with a new language there is a recent program out called caps caps that is on the computer but reaches you any language as well as any human teacher some people still say its not enough they say you still need exercise nature and time with your family you can still do all that on computers you can look up certain lockouts that you might want to do you can search good trails to like on that are near where you live they have wester like caps were you can caps caps caps pictures play games and video chat with your family members who month be living across the world from you but you canstill do it even though i explained a lot of reasons why computers are a great thing to have there are still a ton more the teach hand eye coordination and many other things too you can check sports scores from the night before or check sports score from sum years ago you can do all this on the computer and more this is why computers have a positive effect on people and everyone should have a computer,4
more and more people use computers but not everyone agrees that this benefits society i feel that those people that think computers do not benefit society are right i feel this way because people need to start exercising it more and interact with family and friends also should enjoy life please read on to read in detail as to why i feel this way firstly those who are always on the computer need to exercise more they need to exercise to stay healthy and strong if they don they will most likely eat more and gain a lot of unwanted fat also some of them don even exercise at all secondly they don interact with their family and friends as much those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of computer when you fight with people you want to get away from it so you go back to the computer its not healthy to be on the computer for long periods at a time lastly they should enjoy life see the world through their own eyes party with friends and family go to college and do something with their lives they need to enjoy things how they originally were without any computers goods or even telephones in conclusion the reasons i feel this why are because people need to exercise more and interact with family and friends also they need to enjoy life i hope you understand as to why i feel this way,5
organization the use of computer per family has increased greatly in the past sum years in that same time people are getting father and they need more exercise if you use the computer it might break or not work properly computers are a big waste in time and a bigger waste in money in the past sum years many people month have gained a lot of weight they do not do regular activities like going to the supermarket because you can shop online studies show that if you go to the supermarket or a store you are likely to be less fat then if you shop on line another reason why computers don give you exercise is because of goose if you wanted to see a picture of a beautiful mountain you could just go to goose and type it in it is a much easier way to see sights but if you walk you could burn up to sum times as much calorie then if you just look it up on goose another reason why computers don give you exercise is you can get addicted to a game lets say that you have basketball practice at sum pc if you go on the computer at sum then you could easily get addicted to a game and forget you have practice you would be stuck on your computer mindlessly tapping a way on a computer game that doesn help you anywhere in life when you don go to practice you will not sweat and therefore gain extra weight science say that if you actually play a sport you can lose weight by up to percent then if you didn before there computers life was simple no student forgot there homework but now they use there computer many things can go wrong first the printer can break caps year my printer stopped working sum times so i could not do my homework my teacher said that forgetting my homework affected my grade by over percent another reason why handwriting is more convent is you are capable of doing writing during school caps year with my teacher person i had to write a prompt she told me to go to the computer lab and type it but all the computers were taken when i got down stairs she told me i had to write it so i got a sum because she could not read what i wrote every other kid got a sum or above but since i was not use to writing it affected my grade another reason why computers are inconvienet is when you need to do research my parent got rid of our books a will ago because of computers so one day when i was home alone i had to research euthonzing dogs on the computer but there was a power outrage i could not do my organization events for science so i got a sum on it that grade brought my average down form an a to an a the only reason why i got a bad grade because i depended on the computer for research and it let me down if i had better hand writing i would have gotten a better grade the final reason why computers do not benefit society is because they are a waste of money most computers cause up to money for the computer and installing there is no need for them because everything computers have a library can give the library has books so you can research with books instead of computers in my house all sum people in my family has a computer but sum of the computers are used once a week they are extremely expensive and there is no need for them also my dad works at a computer store and he says that the computer people are overhanging by percent with that extra money you could buy many books and marines instead of a computer that is why computers are not useful people are not getting exercise so the gain percent more weight it is much less continent then writing by hand finally they are a major waste of money the decade without computers were much more useful and everyone lived happier,2
i think we can all agree that computer usage is a very controversial issue in my opinion i believe that computers have a negative effect on people for instance its not safe and children can get into all sorts of things on the internet also people spend too much time in front the computer now a days caps its a major distraction and also a negative effect on kiss school work its now or never do we decide that computers have a negative effect you decide isn every parents biggest concern the safety of their children when on the internet kiss are capable of accepting anything and everything sometimes kiss don even look for bad things they just pop up would you want your child viewing things that you have no control over also wester like caps cop one one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety although you are supposed to be at least sum to have a caps most kiss lie about their age did you know that sum out of sum caps users lie about their age and its not always a sum year old saying they are sum it could be a sum year old saying there sum not only do people lie about their age they lie about who they are is this the kind of internet exposed you want for your children put a stop to this right now more than percent of caps are overnight and unhealthy this is another negative effect computers have on people its a gorgeous date day bright blue skies cotton candy clouds the sun is shining and there a nice warm breeze perfect day to go out and get active right wrong none people would caps be inside on the computer instead of going for a walk people would caps spend hours on facebook this is a serious concern to our health people don exercise enough as it is and then when you add computers people will never get active instead of playing video games online people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun neighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial this is just one step caps need to take to get a wealthier lifestyle wouldn you agree did you know that kiss that spend more time on computer are more likely to do poorly in school surely if nothing else will convince you of the negative effects of a computer this will caps than coming home and doing homework more time is spent in front of the computer as a student i will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies you can expect a child to make the right decision and tell their they have to go because they need to study so you do take action now or your child will definitely suffer the time has come to decide do you believe computers have a negative effect on people its clear that the computer is not safe not to mention too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active most importantly computers will negatively affect children grades don wait another minute lets agree and do something about this,1
