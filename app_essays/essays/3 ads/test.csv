some people think it is a good idea and same do not my opinion is that i think that people spend a lot of time for good reasons here are three reasons why sum grownup working sum students learning how to type and sum communicating with others my first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer for example they do taxes paperwork airline tickets and the bank and those are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don drive my second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write on paper it helps them build learning ability and also so they can know how to sing the organization s computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age my last reason is communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person computers help because if you mess up of what your trying to say then you could just ease what your trying to say and in person you can also you can make plans with one of your friend on something if they live really far or something like that in my opinion i think people should be able to go on the computers to do work playmates no sites and many more other things to go on only if you have a computer at home,,30
