dear local newspaper i feel very strong about my opinion of what effects computers have on people as in it helps others communicate with one another give people into about different types of things and make people smarter to me that sounds like something with a positive effect would you say first of all as some people say it doesn let you interact with family members yes it truly does you can interact with both friends and family members by going to chat rooms such as aim meeboweb can meeting such as skypecom so that throw that concern out or the window you work have to worry about that secondly you get to learn into about different types of things such as learning about wild animals any animal like a grief cat rat or learn about different places like location location and location etc also you could find all of this into at home in one day most important i would make people smarter the computer reaches you hand eye coordinations for free the computer can teach you about any career or regular job that you would need to learn about in just minutes if needed to conclude computers have positive effect on people it lets people communicate with friends and family you get to learn about different types of things and it makes people smarter even i was done reading this it i thanked the lord for computer it helps us so much,,31
