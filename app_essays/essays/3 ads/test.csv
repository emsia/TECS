isn it great getting a refreshing when your outside wouldn you experiences the rush of jumping into the crashing waves of the location instead of sitting inside gazing at pictures of the location you might think that computers are helping society today but you are wrong the human race has survived over hundreds of years without computers and we can survive hundreds more computers are helping society become more and more lazy we can get just as much information out of books if we try our best handed coordination is important and we can get it though activities such as football and tennis we can also get it from activities drawing reading and even playing an instrument can all improve handed coordination while letting you explore your creative side some people believe that computers teach handed coordination and it can but there are better ways to get it it would take longer to get it from a computer than an activity many people like to travel in all different places of the world but going to a foreign area with no knowledge don smart at all so what do you do go the most convenient source internet but what if i told you that any person could put anything on the internet you could be getting into on location when you think your getting into on location the most reliable source would be from a book reading is very powerful especially if your reading from a good source kiss lately have been making lives on the internet the only way they communicate is through online chat charting online canshould never replace time in person with friends relationships with others online is never real were using our knowledge of how to communicate with others the internet isn worth it so as you can see computers are no good thank you,,23

dear local newspaper i feel very strong about my opinion of what effects computers have on people as in it helps others communicate with one another give people into about different types of things and make people smarter to me that sounds like something with a positive effect would you say first of all as some people say it doesn let you interact with family members yes it truly does you can interact with both friends and family members by going to chat rooms such as aim meeboweb can meeting such as skypecom so that throw that concern out or the window you work have to worry about that secondly you get to learn into about different types of things such as learning about wild animals any animal like a grief cat rat or learn about different places like location location and location etc also you could find all of this into at home in one day most important i would make people smarter the computer reaches you hand eye coordinations for free the computer can teach you about any career or regular job that you would need to learn about in just minutes if needed to conclude computers have positive effect on people it lets people communicate with friends and family you get to learn about different types of things and it makes people smarter even i was done reading this it i thanked the lord for computer it helps us so much,,31
