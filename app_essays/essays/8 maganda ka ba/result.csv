"i believe computers aren t having a positive effect on people in this time period for some people they ve really taken over their lives there are many health concerns that take place in a generation full of computers also there is less time in your schedule for more important things when you re addicted to facebook also money will always be less when computers come along computers can really be dangerous to you health for example all that typing can lead to arthritis in the hands and fingers in the long run did you know more seizure are induced by compexors than epileptics d location is as saying people don t cause obesity computers do caps also thinks that the majority of the obeisity is caused by an addiction to computer games ever been depressed than taken a long nature walk and felt great well a lot of people tell on rely on their computer when they re down computers usually make things worse when on twitter facebook goodie and you tube all the time its hard to find time for even the most important things for example if you re a parent your child might feel abandoned if you start caring about the computer more than very little time spent together could turn them to alcohol or smoking i let you never of a computer like that computer can be good way to wind down but they can also become an addiction there when your addicted to sitting on a computer you forget about the beauty of nature money can also contribute to the addiction for example shopping addictions are a good way to blow money because it s so easy all you have to do is type in a credit card number which gives you the illusion that your not spending money until the bill comes another thing is kids websites like wedding which you need to pay for you also need to pay for internet and the electricity bill it s clear to see that computers cause nothing but health problems less time in your daily schedule and the money out of you pocket to me computers are just a trouble in our lives",5,9
"in my opinion i think that computers have a good affect on people i think this because about millions of people use computers everyday the affects on them are that people get learn things easier there are millions of a job sites that would have to do with something of learning about nut of college students go online and do challenge if you were a college student and did college online you would see your family more won t be a hassle to get to college and would be easier to concentrate being by your self and learning also they even make stone which is very popular learning a different language and where you learn this from is on a computer my second reason is to talk on the about nut of our daily online phone you and you can also the cool them even more that have you talk to give i know have a facebook give don t get think it would be a good chore up free so in conclusion i think that there good effects on people that use cpu also when everyone that uses their cpu they still enjoy the nature talk to their family so if you don t have a cpu you get one and will do other fun stuff you like",5,8
"wouldn t you agree that spending time on the computer takes away half of your life going on the computer can have a negative effect on you personally i think not going on the computer benefits you caps s more time for your family going outside and staying healthy certainly going on the computer will mean less time for exercising for example lets say you went on the computer for an hour that hour could have been used to go outside and stay fit think about the choices here you could either sit on a chair and play on the computer or take a nice run and burn a ton of galleries statistics show that percent of people that go on the computer instead of getting exercise are in risk for health problems including obesity as you can clears see going on the computer really isn the healthiest choice to go most defiantly going on a walk or enjoying nature is better than going on a computer a girl named person from location i love to enjoy the beauty of the outdoors that god gave to me i wish i knew that years ago while i was a lazy woman on the if you just even look out your window to see this beautiful god created for us you would want to go out there and enjoy caps everyone wants to live like there dying or in other words live life to the fullest in order to do that you have to see life and go out there and exuberance caps not sit on a computer without a doubt this world is gorgeous and caps is worth while to see the nature everyone knows that family comes before everything for example you might love the computer but that love should not over power your time you spent with your family one day on a date night person was on the computer and her mother called saying person caps s time for dinner person ignored her mom and chose to go on the computer now you really cannot give up time with your friends and family since they are so important i know with my heart and saw that my family means the world to me and everyone shown more time for each family member not the computer its now or never to decide if computers benefit society or not with no computers you could have so much free time for your friends and family if you could only imagine most importantly caps will not only benefit you but caps will mean a lot to your family so what are you waiting for get off the computer and spend some quality time with your family",1,7
